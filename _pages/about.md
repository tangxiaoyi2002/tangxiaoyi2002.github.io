Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I am a master student at the University of Chicago with a concentration in Economics. In Summer 2025, I will be a Predoctoral Fellow at [The Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I hold a B.A. in Economics from Minzu University of China. I am grateful to Minzu University of China for funding my visiting to UC Berkeley in 2022 through the *Scholarship to Visit Top Universities in the World*. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf). My research interests are in environmental economics and labor economics. 

I am a first-generation college student. In my free time, I immerse myself in the world of Chinese classical music. I started playing Guzheng (a Chinese traditional plucked zither) since I was a child. My interests also extend to the rich tradition of Chinese poetry and novels, along with a deep appreciation for the history and culture of China.

Feel free to reach out, I’m always happy to chat!
