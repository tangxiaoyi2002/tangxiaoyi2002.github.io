Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I'm a senior student studying at the Innovation Class for Top Talents in Economics, Minzu University of China, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jing Liu](https://eco.muc.edu.cn/info/1373/3667.htm). I went to UC Berkeley as a visiting student last year. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf).

I'm excited to apply my academic insights and research skills to conduct economic research. I believe in the power of empirical analysis, where convincing data and causal inference can address some of the world's most pressing challenges and provide useful suggestions for future development. My long-term goal is to work in academia and I'm now working to apply for an ECON PhD position first. 

I'm actively seeking research opportunities that align with my research interests in applied microeconomics, health economics, and development economics. Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
