Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I am a master student at the University of Chicago with a concentration in Economics. In Summer 2025, I will be a Predoctoral Fellow at [The Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I hold a B.A. in Economics from Minzu University of China. I went to UC Berkeley as a visiting student in 2022. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf). My research interests are in environmental and labor economics. 

Feel free to reach out, I’m always happy to chat!
