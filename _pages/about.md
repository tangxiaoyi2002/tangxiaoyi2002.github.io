Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I am a master student at the University of Chicago with a concentration in Economics. In Summer 2025, I will be a Predoctoral Fellow at The Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard University. I graduated from Minzu University of China with a degree in Economics. I went to UC Berkeley as a visiting student in 2022. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf). My research interests are in environmental and labor economics. Feel free to contact me at [xiaoyitang@uchicago.edu](mailto:xiaoyitang@uchicago.edu), I’m always happy to chat!
