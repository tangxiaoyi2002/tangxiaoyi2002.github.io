Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I am a master student at the University of Chicago with a concentration in Economics. In summer 2025, I will be a Predoctoral Fellow at [The Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I hold a B.A. in Economics from Minzu University of China. I am grateful to Minzu University of China for funding my visiting to UC Berkeley in 2022 through the *Scholarship to Visit Top Universities in the World*. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf). My research interests are in environmental economics and labor economics. 

I am a Chinese and first-generation college student. Feel free to reach out at [xiaoyitang@uchicago.edu](mailto:xiaoyitang@uchicago.edu), I’m always happy to chat!
